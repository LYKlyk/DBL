# Decoupled and Boosted Learning for Skeleton-based Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition

## Introduction
In this paper, we propose a lightweight dual-stream framework based on decoupled and boosted learning for skeleton-based dynamic hand gesture recognition. We evaluate our model on three challenging datasets: SHRECâ€™17 Track dataset, FPHA dataset, and DHG-14/28 dataset. Experimental results show the superiority of our method.
